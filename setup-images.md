# Product Images Setup Guide

## Real Product Images for E-Commerce

I'll help you set up real product images. Here are the recommended approaches:

### Option 1: Use Free Stock Images (Recommended for Development)

Create these directories:
```
E-Commerce/
├── images/
│   ├── products/
│   │   ├── electronics/
│   │   ├── clothing/
│   │   ├── books/
│   │   └── home/
│   └── thumbnails/
```

### Free Image Sources:
1. **Unsplash** (https://unsplash.com/) - High quality, free images
2. **Pexels** (https://www.pexels.com/) - Free stock photos
3. **Pixabay** (https://pixabay.com/) - Free images and photos

### Option 2: Use Product APIs (For Real Products)

1. **Amazon Product API** - Real product data and images
2. **eBay API** - Product listings with images
3. **Best Buy API** - Electronics with official images

### Option 3: Create Image Upload System

The Spring Boot backend I'm creating includes:
- File upload endpoints
- Image storage management
- Thumbnail generation
- Image optimization

## Current Image URLs in Code

I'll update the JavaScript to use local images instead of placeholder URLs.

## Next Steps:

1. Choose your preferred option above
2. I'll update the frontend code to use real images
3. Set up the backend image upload system
4. Create sample products with real images

Would you like me to:
1. Set up local image storage with sample images?
2. Integrate with a free image API?
3. Create the complete image upload system?
